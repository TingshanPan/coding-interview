# 1.2 Two Sum Pattern

## Summary

There will be two main method to solve the Two Sum Pattern problem: Two Points and HashMap.

### Two Pointers:

Use two pointers `left` and `right` start from begining and the end.

* If `array[left] + array[right] == target` : return solution
* If `array[left] + array[right] > target`  : `right--`
* If `array[left] + array[right] < target`  : `left++`

### HashMap:

Iterate over the whole array, for each number check whether `target - number` is in the HashMap.

* If `map.contains(target - number)` : return solution
* Else : add current number to the HashMap

The solution depends on how we clarify the problem:

* Sorted array: Prefer two pointers.
* Unsorted array: One pass scan and store in HashMap will be better.
* With duplicates: May need extra HashSet to deduplicate.

### 2 Sum - Unsorted

HashMap to store the visited element, for each iteration, check whether the complement in the map.

### 2 Sum - Sorted

Two pointers from begin and end, decrement right when `sum > target`, increment left when `sum < target`.

### 2 Sum - All Pairs Indices

HashMap to store number and list of indices, for each iteration, check the complement and enumerate all possible indices pairs of current number pair.

### 2 Sum - All Unique Pairs

* Solution 1: Sort + Two Pointers, skip duplicates after finding pairs
* Solution 2: HashMap to record `<number, index>`, and Set to deduplicate pair

### 2 Sum - Greater

Sort + Two Pointers, when sum is greater than target, than for current right, the pair sum with left in range `[left, right)` will all be greater than target.

### 2 Sum - Smaller

Sort + Two Pointers, when sum is smaller than target, than for current left, the pair sum with right in range `(left, right]` will all be smaller than target.

### 2 Sum - Closest

Sort + Two Pointers, maintain one global min difference, update result if the difference between sum and target is smaller.

### 2 Sum - Data Structure Design

Optimize `add()`:

* Solution 1: HashMap for counter, add O\(1\) and find O\(n\)
* Solution 2: ArrayList + Sort + Two Pointers to find, add O\(1\) and find O\(nlogn\)

Optimize `find()`:

* Solution 1: HashMap for counter + Set for all sums, add O\(n\) and find O\(1\) 
* Solution 2: ArrayList + Insertion Sort + Two Pointers to find, add O\(n\) and find O\(n\)

### 2 Sum - Difference

* Solution 1: Two Pointers similar to sliding window, guarantee `left < right` and not out of bound
* Solution 2: HashMap and check whether `array[i] + target` or `array[i] - target` in the map

### 3 Sum

### 3 Sum - Greater

### 3 Sum - Closest

### 4 Sum
